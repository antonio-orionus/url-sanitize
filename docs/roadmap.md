# Roadmap

This document is the **canonical roadmap** for `url-sanitize`. It captures both the planned releases and the reasoning behind the decisions, so future contributors (and future-me) don't lose context. For day-to-day repo commands and agent-specific conventions, see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Current status

Public package state before the v0.1.2 alignment release:

- npm: `@url-sanitize/core`, `@url-sanitize/clearurls`, `@url-sanitize/cli` are currently public at v0.1.0.
- crates.io: `url-sanitize-core`, `url-sanitize` are currently public at v0.1.1.
- v0.1.2 is the alignment release that brings npm, crates.io, PyPI, and native GitHub Release assets onto one version.
- TypeScript and Rust engines pass the same conformance corpus.
- The Rust CLI embeds a pinned ClearURLs-compatible catalog and supports structured, deterministic output.

The next adoption bottleneck is not behavior. It is distribution: people should be able to remove tracking parameters from URLs from npm, PyPI, crates.io, Homebrew, Scoop, direct GitHub Release downloads, and CI environments.

## Strategic bet

`url-sanitize` is a rarely-needed, do-one-thing utility. It should win on the `jq` / `ripgrep` / `yt-dlp` model: tiny single binary, installable everywhere, callable ad-hoc by humans and AI agents.

The adoption rule is blunt: meet people in their package manager, but run the same native core wherever possible.

1. **Everywhere install** — crates.io, PyPI, GitHub Release binaries, Homebrew, Scoop, AUR, and CI/container environments should land on one native binary; npm stays pure TypeScript until native npm packages are worth the extra registry overhead.
2. **Agent-native output** — structured JSON, deterministic output, and explainable matches make this usable by agents without scraping terminal text.
3. **Correctness + explainability** — never break a URL silently; report which param, redirect provider, or block rule fired.
4. **Fresh rules with permissive engine licensing** — daily-synced ClearURLs-compatible data, MIT engine, no AGPL lock-in.
5. **Multi-source later** — AdGuard/Brave/Firefox sources matter, but only after the install story is strong enough for users to notice.

The moat is execution and reach, not secrecy. The engine is small glue around public rule lists; the project wins by being the most correct, most current, most installable, and most automation-friendly option.

## Target architecture

One behavioral spec, many shells:

└── sources/                     # upstream sync scripts
```

Engine decisions:

- The Rust `url-sanitize-core` crate is the canonical native core for the Rust CLI, PyPI package, Homebrew/Scoop/AUR packages, GitHub Release binaries, and CI/container wrappers.
- The pure TypeScript engine remains first-class. JS users should not be forced into WASM or native binaries for ordinary library use.
- The conformance corpus is the law. TypeScript, Rust, Python wrappers, WASM, and native launchers must agree on behavior or CI fails.
- Language packages are adoption channels, not excuses to fork behavior. Prefer packaging or invoking the native binary over maintaining another sanitizer implementation.

## Guardrails

- **Correctness over coverage.** A cleaner that strips a real query param or mangles a path is worse than no cleaner.
- **Deterministic by default.** Pinned rules are the default for non-interactive use; live updates are opt-in. `--version` and structured output must surface catalog identity.
- **Licensing is legal, not marketing.** Verify each upstream list before bundling; keep NOTICE and [`docs/license-model.md`](license-model.md) rigorous.
- **No registry squatting.** Reserve names only when the milestone actually publishes them.
- **Demand sets priority.** Ship what humans, CI, and agents actually invoke before speculative wrappers.

## v0.1 — ClearURLs-compatible core + Rust CLI

**Ships:**

- `@url-sanitize/core` — pure algorithm, factory pattern `compileSanitizer(catalog, options)`, discriminated-union result type, zero deps
- `@url-sanitize/clearurls` — ClearURLs catalog adapter + bundled snapshot + SHA256 verified during sync
- `@url-sanitize/cli` — minimal: positional URL args, `--json`, `--strip-referral`, `--help`
- `url-sanitize-core` — Rust engine crate matching the TypeScript behavior contract
- `url-sanitize` — native Rust CLI with embedded ClearURLs-compatible catalog
- Shared conformance corpus for TypeScript and Rust
- Daily sync workflow → opens PR on rule changes with auto-generated changeset
- Vitest snapshot suite — fixtures live in `sources/clearurls/fixtures/`
- CI workflow — typecheck, lint, test, build, generated-corpus freshness, Rust conformance, binary size check
- License model docs + threat model + non-goals + ClearURLs compatibility migration guide

**Deferred from day 1 (intentionally):**

- `@url-sanitize/fetch` — runtime hot-refresh. Adds network surface; ship only after API stable.
- `@url-sanitize/action` — GitHub Action. Distribution channel, not core value. Ships after CLI proves out.
- Profiles (`safe`/`standard`/`aggressive`) — locks API too early. Start with explicit option flags, add profile shorthand once real-world combinations emerge.

## v0.2 — Distribution reach

**Ships:**

- GitHub Release binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows across common architectures, with SHA256SUMS.
- Release automation for archives, shell installer, PowerShell installer, and Homebrew/Scoop-ready assets.
- npm CLI remains pure TypeScript in v0.2 to avoid many platform package names and trusted-publisher setup. Native npm optional packages stay deferred until there is clear demand.
- PyPI package named `url-sanitize` with `python -m url_sanitize`, a `url-sanitize` console script, and a tiny `sanitize(url, **opts)` helper. v0.2 locates `URL_SANITIZE_BIN` or `url-sanitize` on `PATH`; platform-specific bundled wheels are deferred until there is demand.
- Homebrew and Scoop packages. AUR if cheap; Winget when Windows demand or automation makes it worthwhile.
- CI/install docs for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Dockerfiles, direct binary download, npm, cargo, PyPI, brew, and scoop.
- Packaging smoke tests proving each ecosystem wrapper invokes the same binary version/catalog hash and supports `--json`, stdin, and `--version`.

**Why before more features:**

`url-sanitize` is a small utility. Adoption comes from being available exactly where a user already is. More rule sources help later; first, the binary needs doors into every common environment.

## v0.3 — CI integration

**Ships:**

- `@url-sanitize/action` — scans Markdown / docs / PR diffs for tracking-laden URLs
- Modes: `comment` (PR comment with cleaned URLs), `check` (fail CI), `fix` (commit patch)
- Sample workflow showing docs-hygiene gate
- `@url-sanitize/mcp` if agent demand is stronger than GitHub Action demand: exposes `sanitize_url` with pinned, explainable, structured output.

## v0.4 — Runtime catalogs + custom rules

**Ships:**

- `@url-sanitize/fetch` — fetch + SHA256-verify upstream catalog at runtime. Supports `pinnedHash` option for SaaS / paranoid deployments where consumer hardcodes a known-good hash and refuses any other.
- User-defined catalogs via plain TypeScript `SanitizerCatalog` literal
- JSON Schema export for validating user-supplied catalogs
- Custom allowlist / blocklist composition helpers
- `mergeCatalogs(...)` utility

## v1.0 — Stable release

**Ships:**

- Stable public API on `@url-sanitize/core` (semver-stable result types, options object, exported types)
- Documented threat model + license boundaries
- Published benchmark numbers
- `SECURITY.md` with responsible-disclosure policy
- Fuzz-testing in CI — ReDoS guard, 10k random URLs/run, fails if any sanitize call exceeds 50ms
- Signed/provenance-backed native releases where the distribution tooling supports it.
- Every package ecosystem wrapper proves it invokes the same version/hash of the Rust binary or passes the same conformance smoke subset.

## v2.0 — Multi-source expansion

**Trigger conditions (don't ship speculatively):**

Trigger v2.0 work ONLY when at least one of:

- ≥3 unique users file issues asking for non-ClearURLs source coverage
- A paying sponsor appears
- A downstream consumer needs source-merging in production

**Ships if triggered:**

- `@url-sanitize/adguard` — AdGuard URL Tracking Protection filter parsed → `SanitizerCatalog`
- `@url-sanitize/brave` — Brave Debouncer + query-strip list
- `@url-sanitize/firefox` — Firefox query-stripping list (TOML-sourced)
- `@url-sanitize/merged` — union of all 4, dedup, conflict resolution, source priority config

**If never triggered**, v2.0 doesn't happen. ClearURLs-only is a complete product.

## Strategic context (the discussion this came from)

### Why "url-sanitize" not "clearurls-ts"

Three reasons, ranked by weight:

1. **Trademark hygiene.** ClearURLs is someone else's project name. Building a TS project under that brand without explicit blessing risks `cease-and-desist` letters or social-media drama. "ClearURLs-compatible" positioning in docs is safer.
2. **Architecture-first.** v2.0 plans for multi-source expansion. If named `clearurls-ts`, adding AdGuard/Brave packages requires either a rename (loses stars, breaks search) or scope mismatch. `url-sanitize` is forward-compatible from day 1.
3. **Investment signaling.** "url-sanitize" reads as infrastructure. "clearurls-ts" reads as wrapper. Infrastructure attracts contributors; wrappers don't.

### SEO mitigation for the rename

`clearurls-ts` wins exact-match search. `url-sanitize` doesn't. Mitigations baked into day-1 design:

- Package keywords include: `clearurls`, `clearurls-ts`, `clearurls-typescript`, `clearurls-compat`
- README H1 + above-fold opens with "Looking for ClearURLs in TypeScript?"
- Dedicated `docs/clearurls-compat.md` for migration searches
- HN / Reddit launch title front-loads `ClearURLs` keyword

### Why personal namespace, not org

`github.com/antonio-orionus/url-sanitize` + `@url-sanitize` npm scope. Reasons:

- Solo maintainer + <1k stars = org is bureaucracy without benefit
- Personal stars feed `antonio-orionus` profile heatmap (portfolio value)
- npm scope `@url-sanitize` decoupled from GH org — already owned by personal npm account
- Transfer to dedicated org is one-click when triggered by: second maintainer joining, sponsorship arriving, >2k stars, trademark dispute

### License model — MIT + LGPL split

- `@url-sanitize/core` — **MIT** (clean-room TS algorithm port against the public ClearURLs rule spec)
- `@url-sanitize/clearurls` — **MIT (code) + LGPL-3.0-only (bundled `data.json` derived from ClearURLs Rules repo)**
- `@url-sanitize/cli`, `@url-sanitize/fetch`, `@url-sanitize/action` — **MIT**

Why the split unlocks adoption:

- MIT engine = SaaS-friendly. Lets commercial / closed-source projects depend on the algorithm.
- LGPL on data = matches upstream ClearURLs Rules repo. No license-laundering.
- Competitor `@quik-fe/clear-urls` is **AGPL-3.0-only** (entire package). AGPL = network-use copyleft = SaaS adoption-blocker. Confirmed via npm + jsDelivr.
- Consumers who can't tolerate LGPL data can still use `@url-sanitize/core` with a custom catalog.

### Threat model — hash, not signature

ClearURLs ships SHA256 hex at `rules.minify.hash`. **No minisign / no GPG / no cosign.** Confirmed by 404 on `https://rules2.clearurls.xyz/data.minify.json.minisig`.

What this gives us:

- HTTPS + GitHub Pages TLS — transport integrity
- SHA256 file from same origin — consistency check (rules ↔ hash match)
- No provenance proof — compromised upstream origin = compromised everything

What we add:

- Sync workflow verifies hash before writing files; mismatch = abort + retry
- Cache-control issue: hash file has `max-age=600` (10min). Hash can be stale vs JSON. Sync script + workflow retry on mismatch instead of failing immediately.
- v0.2: `@url-sanitize/fetch` exposes `pinnedHash?: string` for consumer-side hash pinning (refuse any rules whose hash differs from the pinned value)

Stricter integrity (e.g. signing) would need upstream ClearURLs maintainers to opt in. Not our project's gap to fix.

### Why factory pattern over module singleton

Module-level `let cached: …` (anti-pattern from Arroxy's original `applyRules.ts`):

- Forbids multiple catalogs co-existing
- Breaks hot-reload — no clean cache invalidation
- Breaks SSR — mutable module-level state shared across requests

`compileSanitizer(catalog, opts) → fn` closure:

- Multiple catalogs co-exist (test fixtures + prod rules)
- Hot-reload: swap catalog, swap compiled function
- SSR-safe: no module-level state
- Tree-shakeable: dead-code-elim drops algorithm if consumer only fetches catalog

### Why discriminated union result, not bare string

Existing forks (`@quik-fe/clear-urls`, `@brandonkal/url-purify`, `@mkljczk/url-purify`) all return `string`. Loses information:

- Which provider matched? Useful for telemetry.
- Which params stripped? Useful for debugging.
- Was this a redirect unwrap or a param strip? Different security implications.

```ts
type SanitizeResult =
  | { kind: 'unchanged'; url: string }
  | { kind: 'cleaned'; original, url, strippedParams, matchedRules }
  | { kind: 'redirected'; original, url, via }
  | { kind: 'blocked'; original, via }
```

Consumers `switch (result.kind)` exhaustively. New variants = compile error.

### Why `domainBlocking` opt-in

ClearURLs has `completeProvider: true` (refuse to load URL entirely). Browser-extension semantics — wrong default for libraries. Most consumers want "clean if possible, pass through if not". Blocking is an opt-in.

### Catalog model — unified, source-tagged

`SanitizerRule` is a discriminated union over `kind` (`strip-param` / `raw-replace` / `unwrap-redirect` / `block-domain`). Every rule carries `source: RuleSource` (`clearurls` / `adguard` / `brave` / `firefox` / `custom`).

- Adapters live in source-specific packages and convert native formats → unified shape
- Core algorithm doesn't know which source produced a rule
- v2.0 multi-source merge becomes trivial: concat catalogs, optionally dedup
- Consumers can query "which source caught this?" via `matchedRules[].source`

### Fuzz testing — differentiator nobody else has

ClearURLs ruleset = ~200 provider regexes from random contributors. ReDoS risk is real (catastrophic backtracking in user-supplied URLs can hang a server).

Day-1 CI step in `packages/core/test/fuzz.test.ts` (v0.1 stretch, v1.0 mandatory):

- 10k random URLs → compiled sanitizer
- Assert no execution > 50ms
- Assert no thrown exceptions outside expected catches

Catches catastrophic-backtracking regexes upstream ships before they reach consumers. No existing fork does this.

### Non-goals (won't ship, ever)

See [docs/non-goals.md](non-goals.md). Stops scope-creep PRs cold.

## Compared-to existing options (for the README's positioning)

| Option | Stance |
| --- | --- |
| ClearURLs browser extension | End-user product, not a library. We're orthogonal. |
| ClearURLs Rules repo | We consume their feed. Upstream of us. |
| `@quik-fe/clear-urls` | AGPL-3.0-only. Adoption-blocker for SaaS. We solve license. |
| `@brandonkal/url-purify` | Static fork, no sync. We solve freshness. |
| `@mkljczk/url-purify` | Static fork, no sync. Same gap. |
| Hand-rolled regexes per project | Stale within months. We solve maintenance. |
| Brave Query String Filter | Browser-native, not a library. Different audience. |
| AdGuard URL Tracking filter | Filter-list format, not API. We could adapt (v2.0). |
| Unalix Python / Nim | Archived. Confirms TS gap. |
